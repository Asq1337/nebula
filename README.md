## building

i know you have to have a massive fucking brain to like run a few command line commands or boot this bad bitch into intellij, but ima give you the instructions anyway

you have two options:

1. Go to the [Actions]() tab and grab the latest jar if the build didn't fail
2. If you don't want to/build failed/making a pr
   1. git clone the repo (or download via zip i dont fucking care)
   2. open in command line and run:
      1. `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`
      2. `gradlew clean`
      3. `gradlew build`
   3. get jar from build/libs/nebula-1.0.0.jar
   4. profit

oh you also need java 8 installed whoopies i should've mentioned that
